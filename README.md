# Bulls and Cows

For those of you who loved Wordle, but are better with digits than with letters, here is another game called Bulls and Cows. 

The rules are very straightforward:

* You need to guess a number (technically speaking, it can start with 0 so it might not be a number) that consists of 5 unique digits
* Each round your guess is checked against the true number that was generated randomly
* If you guess both the digits and its position, this is counted as a bull
* If the digit is in the correct number, but the position is different, it is a cow
* Note that what is counted as a bull does not increment the cow counter
* Promise not to use your skills to guess PIN numbers! :)
